## Features

- **Automated Commit Message Generation**: Leverages OpenAI's API to create meaningful commit messages based on your staged changes.
- **User-Provided Context**: Allows you to add an optional description to provide additional context for the commit message.
- **Git Subcommand Integration**: Seamlessly integrates as a Git subcommand (`git llmcommit`), making it easy to use within your existing workflow.
- **README Inclusion**: Incorporates content from your project's README to provide additional context for commit message generation.

## Prerequisites

Before using **LLMCommit**, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.
2. **Git** installed and initialized in your project repository.
3. An **OpenAI Account** with a valid API key.
4. An **Internet Connection** to communicate with OpenAI's API.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install **LLMCommit** on your Ubuntu system:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cotcotquedec/git-llmcommit.git
cd git-llmcommit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python library `openai` using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install openai
```

### 3. Run the Installation Script

Use the provided installation script to set up **LLMCommit**. This script will:

- Verify that Python 3.7+ and `pip3` are installed.
- Install the `openai` library.
- Place the `git-llmcommit` script in `~/bin` and ensure it is executable.
- Add `~/bin` to your `PATH` if it's not already included.
- Prompt you to enter your OpenAI API key if it's not already set.

Execute the installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

**Note**: During the installation, you will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key if it's not already defined in your environment variables.

### 4. Verify `~/bin` is in Your `PATH`

The installation script should automatically add `~/bin` to your `PATH`. You can verify this by running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

You should see `~/bin` listed. If not, ensure that the installation script added it correctly.

## Configuration

To configure **LLMCommit**, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

Add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to make it persistent.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can use **LLMCommit** as a Git subcommand to generate and perform commits automatically.

### Basic Usage

1. **Stage Your Changes**

   Add your changes to the staging area using `git add`:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Generate and Perform Commit**

   Use `git llmcommit` with an optional description to generate and execute the commit:

   ```bash
   git llmcommit -d "Optional description of changes"
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git llmcommit -d "Added user authentication feature"
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Generated commit message: Added user authentication feature, including secure login and session management.
   Commit successful.
   ```

### Command Options

- `-d`, `--description`: *(Optional)* Provides additional context for the commit message.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Commit with Description

```bash
git add .
git llmcommit -d "Implemented password reset functionality"
```

**Output:**

```
Generated commit message: Implemented password reset functionality, allowing users to securely reset their passwords via email.
Commit successful.
```

### Example 2: Commit Without Description

If you omit the `-d` option, the commit message will be generated based solely on the staged changes and README content.

```bash
git add .
git llmcommit
```

**Output:**

```
Generated commit message: Refactored codebase for improved performance and readability.
Commit successful.
```

## Best Practices

- **Review Generated Messages**: Always review the generated commit messages for accuracy before pushing to a remote repository.
- **Use Descriptions Wisely**: Provide meaningful descriptions to enhance the quality of the generated messages.
- **Maintain README**: Keep your README up-to-date to provide accurate context for message generation.

## Security

- **Protect Your API Key**: Never share your OpenAI API key or commit it to version control.
- **Data Privacy**: Be cautious of the code content sent to OpenAI's API, especially if it contains sensitive information.
